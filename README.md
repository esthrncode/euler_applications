Welcome! 

## What's This All About?

I've been solving math puzzles on Project Euler, and every time I crack one, I learn something new. Then, I started thinking, "How can I use this in everyday life and my major?". So, I started writing down my ideas here.

## Why I Made This

- **To Remember**: It's like a diary of all the math puzzles I've solved and what I learned from them.
- **To Connect**: I'm showing how math isn't just numbers; it's behind a lot of things we do, especially in health.
- **To Help**: Maybe you're curious about how math and health science fit together too. If so, you're in the right place!

## What You'll Find Here

For each math problem I've worked on, there's a little story:
- [Vitamin Distribution](01problem_vitamin_distribution): Calculating optimal days for Vitamin C and D distribution mimics efficient planning in public health initiatives.
- [Growth Bacteria](02problem_bacterial_growth):The researcher is particularly interested in those moments when the bacterial count is even, as it might indicate a unique genetic expression or reaction to environmental conditions.
